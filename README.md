# Sentiment Analysis for COVID tweets
# Description
Here sentiments of the tweets posted by users in Twitter during COVID-19 pandemic situation are analyzed, whether a tweet belongs to the positive sentiment or negative sentiment. Here two recurrent neural network models (RNN) are used to predict the sentiment of a tweet which are simpleRNN (Simple Recurrent Neural Network) and LSTM (Long Short Term Memory). Apart from this, LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) and SHAP (Shapley Addictive Explanations) are used which helps to explain the predictions of thse two models in a way that humans can understand.

__*LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) gives the best testing accuracy of 92.1 by using the Adam optimizer*__
